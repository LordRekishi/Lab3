## JavaFX Shape Drawing Program - Basic Multiplayer Network functionality

This was our fourth major assignment at IT-HÃ¶gskolan, Java system development vocational school. This was our introduction to "frontend" and JavaFX, as well as the MVC workflow.
The program is a basic SVG shape drawing program with network multiplayer painting and in-memory database as well as basic design patterns like the factory pattern. 

*Please don't judge my old newbie self too harshly. Hopefully my later projects speaks for themselves* :)
